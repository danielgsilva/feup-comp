# Compiler Project

## 1. Optimizations 

### 1.1. Constant propagation and constant folding
*JmmSemanticsResult optimize(JmmSemanticsResult semanticsResult)*

- **Constant Propagation**  
  Replaces variables with their constant values when possible. This is achieved by:
    - Tracking assignments of constant values to (local) variables
    - Replacing variable references with their corresponding constant values in subsequent expressions

- **Constant Folding**  
  Simplifies constant expressions at compile time. This includes:
    - Evaluating arithmetic operations (e.g., `2 + 3` becomes `5`)
    - Simplifying boolean expressions (e.g., `true && false` becomes `false`)

- **Implementation Details**
    - **Visitors**:
        - `ConstantPropagationVisitor`: Traverses the AST, propagating constant values and replacing variable references with constants
        - `ConstantFoldingVisitor`: Simplifies constant expressions by evaluating them directly in the AST
    - **Optimization Process**:
        - Both visitors are applied iteratively until no further changes are detected in the AST

### 1.2. Register allocation

*OllirResult optimize(OllirResult ollirResult);* 

- **Configuration Check**  
    - Checks the option `â€“r=<n>` that controls the register allocation to determine the number of registers to be used - `maxRegs`  
    - If it is set to `-1`, return without any modifications

- **Control Flow Graphs**  
  - Calls `ClassUnit.buildCFGs()` to ensure that the proper connections between instructions are formed

- **Register Allocation Process**  
For each method:
  - **Liveness Analysis**  
    - Uses `analyze()` from `LivenessAnalysis` to compute the use, def, live-in and live-out sets for each instruction
  - **Interference Graph**  
    - Uses `buildGraph()` from `InterferenceGraph` to create the interference graph for the method, using the union of the def and live-outs set
  - **Graph Coloring**  
    - Uses `graphColoring()` from `RegisterAllocation` to color the interference graph, assigning registers to variables and building the map `regAllocation`  
    - If the k registers are not enough, we increase the number of registers and repeat the process until we find a solution and report an error
  - **Update Registers**  
    - Uses `updateRegisters()` from `RegisterAllocation` to update the varTable that each OLLIR method has to reflect the new register allocation
  - **Register Allocation Details**  
    - We print the total number of registers needed and the mapping of each variable to its assigned register, as defined in the method's `varTable`
